# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews
In this repo I have develop a Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews project in machine learning using NLP. In this dataset, there are reviews from the customers which are either positive or negative. And now we are going to build a machine learning model using Count Vectorizer method. And finally, this model is going to predict whether the given review is either positive or negative.
